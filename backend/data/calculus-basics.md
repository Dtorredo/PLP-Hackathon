# Calculus Basics

## Limits

In mathematics, a limit is the value that a function (or sequence) "approaches" as the input (or index) "approaches" some value. Limits are essential to calculus and mathematical analysis, and are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.

The limit of a function f(x) as x approaches p is a number L such that for every real ε > 0, there exists a real δ > 0 such that for all real x, 0 < |x − p| < δ implies |f(x) − L| < ε.

## Derivatives

The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). The derivative of a function y = f(x) of a variable x is a measure of the rate at which the value y of the function changes with respect to the change of the variable x. It is called the derivative of f with respect to x. If x and y are real numbers, and if the graph of f is plotted against x, the derivative is the slope of this graph at each point.

The simplest case is when y is a linear function of x, meaning that the graph of y is a straight line. In this case, y = f(x) = mx + b, for some real numbers m and b, and the slope m is given by the change in y divided by the change in x.

## The Chain Rule

In calculus, the chain rule is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function. That is, if f and g are differentiable functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composite f ∘ g — the function which maps x to f(g(x)) — in terms of the derivatives of f and g.

The formula for the chain rule is:
(f ∘ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)
